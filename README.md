# linear-model-project

In this project, we explore a kidney data set to find the best model to predict creatinine clearance (a measure of kidney function). Creatinine clearance (CC) is clinically difficult to obtain, therefore researchers wish to study whether CC can be predicted from other easily available characteristics from patients. This data set contains 300 observations of 9 variables. We begin with an exploratory data analysis to examine the different variables and any possible relationships therein. Next, we perform model selection using forward selection (including interactions). We check model assumptions and determine that there is some amount of non-constant variance. We then fit several non-constant variance models and select the best one using AIC scores. The estimated model is defined and coefficients are interpreted. Next, we make predictions for a hypothetical new patient. We make inference as to whether the sex of the patient changes the model. We quickly explain how to adjust the model for a classification application. And finally, we make a classification prediction using a basic logistic regression model.
